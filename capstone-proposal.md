`Name of Student`: Erik Zambrano

`Name of Project`: Ana's House Cleaning App

`Project's Purpose or Goal`: The Application is desgned to help a buisness owner more easily schedule a service, keep a log of Employees, the Employee's work availability, Clients, current and upcoming scheduled services, and hopefully I will be able to reach the strech goal of clients being able to make electronic payments, and having an email recipt be sent back to them automaticly. 

`List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal`: The Calandar for keeping track of the Employee's work schedule, the upcoming and current service appointments for the Client.

`What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.`: I suppose just what ever we elarned back in C#. I want to build the entire application using C# .NET core 6. Hopefuly i will be able to come back to this and udate it once I have a more clear vision.

`If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.`: the minimum viable product would be the calandar working, with a list of full CRUD for employees, and the same for Clients. If I have spare time, I will try to hook up Paypal and/or Cashapp APIs so I the application can allow for online transactions.

`What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?`:
Well, Paypal and Cashapp APIs, if I can do that, ,I sort of feel likee this might be more than I can handle. I but I will still try my best.

`Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?` : pray for me.
