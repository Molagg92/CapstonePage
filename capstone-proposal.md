`Name of Project`:\
 Ana's House Cleaning App

`Project's Purpose or Goal`:\
The Application is desgned to help a buisness owner more easily schedule a service, keep a log of Employees, the Employee's work availability, Clients, current and upcoming scheduled services, and hopefully I will be able to reach the strech goal of clients being able to make electronic payments, and having an email recipt be sent back to them automaticly. 

`List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal`:\
This is the absolute minimum featres for the app to meet the goal of helping a buisness owner
* A list of Customers/Clients , full CRUD.
* Clients will be able to log in with their own accounts, with authentication, schedule a service, and see a list of recipts/purchase history.
* A list of Employees, full CRUD.
* Employees will be able to log in with their own accounts, with authentication, submit their availablity , request time off, request schedule edits.
* 3 diffrent types of Services _(or just one with 3 diffrent faces)_. Standard Cleaning. Deep Cleaning. Partial Cleaning. Once more, full CRUD.
* Services will be assined to Employees by the ADMIN. or the Buisnessowner in this case.
* The ability to schedule a Serivce for a Client, then assign Employees to the Service. Also full CRUD.
* Full Calandar system showing Employee availability, future/past scheduled services, and highlights/greys out 1-4 hour time blocks. It suppose to make it easy to read.

`What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.`:\
 I want to build the entire application using C# .NET core 6, AspNetCore Identity, will be using MSTEST UnitTesting to show my work. MVC File Structure. For the backend I will be using MySQL, need to read on how to Migrate again. Will be styling the UI with CSS and HTML, excited for that.  I just learned about this thing called a DateTime Object. 

`If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.`:\
 If I finish all of that, the next thing to tackle would be the PayPal API. If I can do it, I think it owuld be great if Clients could pay for a Service online. If that ges done, I could also figure out how to auto send back a reciept /thank-you email.

`What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?`:\
Well, Paypal and Cashapp APIs, if I can do that, ,I sort of feel likee this might be more than I can handle. I but I will still try my best.

`Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?` :\
 pray for me.
